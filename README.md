# GEMINI APP
This is an AI-powered chat app using Flutter and Google Gemini API. I use the Flutter_gemini package to communicate with the Gemini API from our Flutter app. I set up the app including installing dependencies, generating a Gemini API Key, and chatting with Gemini using Text and images. This is a great app for beginner Flutter developers or anyone who wants to learn about creating AI-powered chat apps using Flutter and the Google Gemini API.
